# Types of coffee and required ingredients
# Coffee machine requirements
# Coin operated==we have american coins penny: 1cent ($0.01), Nickel:5 cent ($0.05),
# Dime:10cent ($0.10) and Quarter:25cents ($0.25)
# Program requirements: a)create report of how much of the requirements such as coffee, water, milk are left
# b) Check if the resources are sufficient if the user orders a drink==> then order a drink
# c) Ask the user to insert a coin: Ask the user how many of particular type coins the user is using in machine
# d) give the user the left money
# e) if resources are no sufficient print no sufficient resources
# f)if money is sufficient then refund the money.Print sorry thats not
